## O2
*Theme: MyMoney Application*

### DESCRIPTION

Implement a system which allows the user to add / take money from his account. The system also shows the balance and gives a warning, when the credit limit is reached.

### IDEA, EXAMPLE

Create a class “Account” which has a username and amount as attributes.

Add methods so that the user can add money and take money from the account. Include a method which shows the current balance.

Implement a simple user interface with a menu. In this menu the user can choose the options (add / remove / show balance). The menu checks for valid inputs.

### DIFFICULTY

Make a clear distinction between data and user interface, by keeping the menu and data (the Account class) separate.

### SCALABILITY

Extend the application and allow the user to have several accounts (saving account, concurrent account). Add a feature which allows the user to transfer money from one account to another.

### PROCESS

Do an activity diagram first of the logic. Then implement an account class with all the features. Then go on to build up a user-interface. Show your implementation to your teacher.
